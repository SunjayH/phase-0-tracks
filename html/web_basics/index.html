    <h2>Primary Types of Tea</h2>
    	<p>Different teas have different names based on the amount of time and the conditions underwhich they are oxidized. Multiple different types of tea can be made from the same tea plant through this process. The most common types of tea are as follows:</p>
    	<ul>
    		<li>Black tea</li>
    		<li>Oolong tea</li>
    		<li>Green tea</li>
    		<li>White tea</li>
    	</ul>
    <h2>How to Brew Tea</h2>
    	<p>Different teas have different needs.</p>
    	<ol>
    		<li>Start the water boiling in a stovetop or electric kettle. I suggest using an aluminum or stainless steel kettle to prevent plastic leaching into your tea.</li>
    		<li>Measure out your tea. A good rule of thumb is one teaspoon per 6-oz cup. You can also use a pre-measured tea bag to make this step easier.</li>
    		<li>Once the water is boiling, you may need to <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5974068/make-the-perfect-cup-of-tea-with-these-steeping-times-and-temperatures">adjust the temperature</a>. For black tea, you can directly pour the boiling water over the tea. For Oolong, Green, and White teas, you will need to pour the water into another vessel to let it sit for a moment.</li>
    		<li>Let the tea steep. This should take 1-3 minutes, depending on the <a href="http://lifehacker.com/this-time-and-temperature-chart-helps-you-brew-the-perf-1447451469">type of tea</a>.</li>
