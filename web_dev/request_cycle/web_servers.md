What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?
1) It uses UNIX semantics and networking models 
2) It has one kernel
3) All the essential parts are completely open source

In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?
It's a software-delimited equivalent of a server, normally purchased from an internet service provider. It's cheaper and more customizable than a physical server, though it may be slower.

Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?
Because then they have permissions to mess up your system! Don't trust any program you downloaded off the internet to not try to mess up your system.
