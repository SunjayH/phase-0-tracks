# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
** Version control allows us to keep track of older versions so that if we mess up we don't mess up the whole project.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
** Branches allow us to make and test modifications without having to modify the original project until we know it works.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
** A commit saves a change in the git history. A good message let's us see what was changed when so we only go as far back as we need.
* What is a merge conflict?
** When two branches conflict with each other in one file
